# DDMM UI Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for Doki Doki Mod Manager. This has been separate since v3.3.0, as it allows for UI updates to be deployed without a full update to the app.

Issues are disabled in this repo - please create issues in the [main repo](https://github.com/DokiDokiModManager/Mod-Manager). Pull requests are welcomed.
